swextract is used to read data from an SGI proprietary .idb file and extract the associated data from its corresponding sw file.

Currently, this project works, but is still in the works.  I have been tweaking what I can, giving more features for ease of use, and customizable options so it isn't something you will need to edit.

Read the INFO file to find out more about the reason this script has been created.

NOTE: I have not yet addressed being able to read from a .sw64 file, so some files may not be retrievable just yet.
